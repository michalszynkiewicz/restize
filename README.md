# Restize
This is an attempt to provide a readable, easy to use

It's written in pure Java on top of Undertow.

Take a look at the tests for examples of usage.

## TODO
- other method types (for now only GET is supported)
- json support
- setting headers
- support user-defined flow elements
- security?
- client
- performance tests & optimization
